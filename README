# chefpaws-logic

Core metabolic engine for ChefPaws nutrition protocols. Standardizes energy requirements and recipe formulations across the stack.

## Technical Specs

### Metabolic Formula

The engine calculates Daily Energy Requirement (DER) using the exponentiated Resting Energy Requirement (RER):

- **RER:** $70 \times (BW_{kg})^{0.75}$
- **DER:** $RER \times ActivityMultiplier$

### Activity Coefficients

- **1.2:** Sedentary / Neutered
- **1.4:** Active / Intact
- **1.6:** Performance / Working

## Integration

### Go Backend

The logic is exposed as a Go module for server-side validation and lead processing.
